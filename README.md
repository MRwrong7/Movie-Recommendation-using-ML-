Movie Recommendation System ðŸŽ¥
A movie recommendation system built using vectorization and cosine similarity techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions. This project demonstrates how to process textual data and create a simple yet effective recommendation engine.

ðŸš€ Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on their descriptions, genres, and other metadata.
Efficient Vectorization: Uses techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer for transforming text data into numerical vectors.
Similarity Calculation: Implements cosine similarity to measure the closeness between movie vectors.
Scalable: Easily extendable to include other recommendation methods (e.g., collaborative filtering).
